# Online Retail Customer Segmentation

We endeavour to find the various customer segments using the online retail store's transaction data obtained from UCI Machine Learning Dataset repository. This is a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.
The need of customer segmentation:

The differences in customers' behaviour, demographics, geographies, etc. help in classifying them in groups. Learning about different groups in the customer can help with following:

1.Target Marketing

2.Client understanding

3.Optimal product placement

4.Searching for new customers

5.Revenue growth

Customer segmentation is the process by which you divide your customers up based on common characteristics – such as demographics or behaviors, so you can market to those customers more effectively. These customer segmentation groups can also be used to begin discussions of building a marketing persona. This is because customer segmentation is typically used to inform a brand’s messaging, positioning and to improve how a business sells – so marketing personas need to be closely aligned to those customer segments in order to be effective.



## Problem Statement

In this project, our task is to identify major customer segments on a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.
## Datasets

Invoice No:- Invoice number. Nominal, a 6-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each transaction. If this code starts with letter 'c', it indicates a cancellation.

StockCode: Product (item) code. Nominal, a 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each distinct product.

Description: Product (item) name. Nominal.

Quantity: The quantities of each product (item) per transaction. Numeric.

InvoiceDate:Invoice Date and time. Numeric, the day and time when each transaction was generated.

UnitPrice:Unit price. Numeric, Product price per unit in sterling.

CustomerID: Customer number. Nominal, a 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each customer.

Country: Country name. Nominal, the name of the country where each customer resides.


## Requirements

To run this project, you will need to have the following packages installed:
1. Python - Programming Language
2. Numpy - Scientific computing library
3. Pandas - Data manipulation library
4. Matplotlib - Data visualization library
5. Seaborn - Data visualization library
## Conclusion

These are the general conclusions that may be drawn from an EDA on the Online Retail Customer Segmentation:

***White Hanging heat T-Light holder is the most demanding gift of all.***

***Lunch bag black skull is the least demanding gift of all.***

***The UK has to purchase a total of $4.2 million in gift items.***

***After the UK, Germany placed maximum orders for unique gift items.***

***The Netherlands has purchased a total of $200 k gift items.***

***Online retail gift shop generates $ 8 + million in revenue from the UK only.***

***This project mainly focused on developing customer segments for a UK based online store, selling unique all occasion gifts.***

***By applying different clustering algorithm to our dataset, we get the optimal number of cluster is equal to 2.***

**The business can focus on these different clusters and provide customer with services of each sector in a different way, which would not only benefit the customers but also the business at large.**
